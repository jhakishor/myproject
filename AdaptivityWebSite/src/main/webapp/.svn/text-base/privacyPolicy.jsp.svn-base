<span>Your privacy on the Internet is important to Adaptivity. As part of the operation of Adaptivity, certain pieces of information are gathered about Adaptivity Contacts and/or Customers. As a customer-first oriented company, Adaptivity insists that our entire firm conform to the highest possible standards of permission from email recipients and will never knowingly participate in the distribution of unsolicited email. Any data, including email addresses, are the property of our customers and contacts and are used under the conditions specified by our customer's directed contact choices. Adaptivity makes every effort to protect your contact information or prevent that data from being known to any other entity. If you ask to be removed from our marketing contact lists then we will do so promptly.</span>

<span>The information contained in this message is confidential and proprietary to Adaptivity, Inc. and is solely for the use of the intended recipient(s). If you are not an intended recipient of this information, you are hereby notified that the use, circulation, quoting, or reproducing of it is strictly prohibited and may be unlawful.</span>
<BR></BR> 
<span>THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS MESSAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS," WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ACCURACY, ADEQUACY, OR ANY OTHER KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. ADAPTIVITY, INC. SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY WHATSOEVER FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR LOST PROFITS OR REVENUES, IN CONNECTION WITH ITS TRANSMISSION OF, OR THE RECIPIENT'S OR ANY THIRD PARTY'S USE OF AND/OR RELIANCE ON, THIS INFORMATION, REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY AND WHETHER OR NOT ADAPTIVITY, INC. HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH.</span> 
<BR></BR>
<h4>Prospective Customers</h4>
<span>As part of the Adaptivity Contact and/or Customer registration process, the prospective Contact and/or Customer is asked to provide an email address and select categories of potential interest. The prospective Contact and/or Customer, at their option, may voluntarily provide additional information, including personal, geographic and demographic information. In addition to the information provided by Contacts and/or Customers, Adaptivity may also collect information about Adaptivity Contacts and/or Customers from third party sources. Furthermore, Adaptivity monitors incoming and outgoing Web site traffic data to help diagnose problems with its servers and to administer its Web site. Adaptivity also uses this data to assemble broad demographic information about its Contacts and/or Customers in general. The purpose of this data collection is to ensure that Adaptivity Contacts and/or Customers receive only the most relevant, targeted offers and information from Adaptivity and for no other purpose.</span>
<BR></BR> 
<span>Adaptivity uses "Contact" data as a way for customers, potential customers and various Contacts to communicate with our team. Adaptivity collects the information supplied by the sender of the "Contact" form in order to establish and maintain relationships for the purposes of providing you information and timely news about Adaptivity and its solutions and services.</span> 
<BR></BR>
<span>Adaptivity also uses email links located on various Adaptivity web pages to allow you to contact Adaptivity with questions or comments you may have. Adaptivity welcomes these email communications and makes efforts to respond to any such communication when appropriate. Email communications and the ideas sent to Adaptivity in these email communications become the property of Adaptivity. Adaptivity uses the email communications to evaluate and improve its services and Web site. Adaptivity may also save these email communications for future reference or use.</span>
<BR></BR> 
<span>As discussed above, Adaptivity may, from time to time, obtain information about its Contacts and/or Customers from third party sources. In addition, Adaptivity may, from time to time, assist third parties in developing, implementing and monitoring advertising campaigns using data owned or supplied by the third party. Please be aware that our Privacy Policy does not cover the conduct or practices of these third party sources. Our Privacy Statement only covers Adaptivity's treatment of this information. However, Adaptivity will treat information that it receives from third party sources according to the terms of our own strict Privacy Policy.</span>
<BR></BR> 
<span>If at some point Adaptivity sells all or a portion of its assets, or merges with another entity, user information is an asset that may be transferred or acquired by a third party. We will notify all affected users of any such transaction and, consistent with our privacy promises, users will have the opportunity to retrieve their user information and cease usage of service on this site. After such a transaction, the third party that becomes the custodian of the user information would have the right to continue using the user information solely as set forth in this policy.</span> 
<BR></BR>
<h4>Cookies</h4>
<span>The Adaptivity may use cookies to assist in delivering the service and to provide a positive and personalized user experience on the site. Cookies are files sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Our persistent and session ID cookies are used to identify unique visitors to our sites and to provide you with easy access to content.</span> 
<BR></BR>
<h4>Third Party Sites</h4>
<span>In order to provide visitors with greater value, some of our pages may provide links to various third party websites. In no case is visitor or registered user information or 'cookies' provided to the third party sites.</span> 
<BR></BR>
<span>However, keep in mind that many sites do attempt to capture visitor information when you browse those sites. Once you leave our site, we are not able to alert you should another site attempt to gather information from your browser. Please review that site's privacy policy when browsing at that site.</span>
<BR></BR>
<h4>Confidentiality</h4> 
<span>Adaptivity will not provide personally identifiable information of an Adaptivity Contact except as noted under "Limits of Confidentiality" (see below). Adaptivity will under no circumstance knowingly reveal any Contact and/or Customer's identity to marketers. It is solely at an Adaptivity Contact and/or Customer's discretion if he or she chooses to provide any information to Adaptivity.</span>
<BR></BR>
<h4>Limits of Confidentiality</h4> 
<span>Due to the existing legal, regulatory and security environment, Adaptivity may be required, under certain circumstances, to disclose aggregate level and/or personally identifiable information about its Contacts and/or Customers. Adaptivity will use its best efforts to limit such disclosure to the following: where Adaptivity believes in good faith that it is required to do so in response to a subpoena or other legal process; where reasonably required to do so in order to maintain, update or otherwise implement Adaptivity's data security measures, equipment, technical operations and the like; or where reasonably necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against persons or entities to preserve and/or enforce Adaptivity's rights.
<BR></BR> 
<h4>Protection of Contact and/or Customer Information</h4> 
<span>Adaptivity undertakes substantial efforts to protect the confidentiality of the identity, preferences and other information it has collected about individual Contacts and/or Customers and will never knowingly allow access to this information to anyone outside Adaptivity other than as described above under the Limits of Confidentiality. Adaptivity has made a substantial investment in its server, database, backup and firewall technologies to protect the information assets of the Adaptivity Network, including the confidentiality of information collected about Adaptivity Contacts and/or Customers. These technologies are deployed as part of a sophisticated security architecture and protocol.</span>
<BR></BR>  
<span>You should also do your part in protecting your information. Your Adaptivity Contact and/or Customer name and any password (if such is provided or enacted) are confidential and we recommend that you not divulge them to anyone. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the Internet as a public transmission network, neither Adaptivity network nor data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect Contact and/or Customer information that is transmitted to us by you, Adaptivity cannot ensure or warrant the security of such Contact and/or Customer information. Thus, any information a Contact and/or Customer transmits to us is done so at the Contact and/or Customer's own risk. Once we receive Contact and/or Customer information, Adaptivity undertakes substantial efforts to protect the confidentiality of this information consistent with this Policy.</span> 
<BR></BR>
<h4>Reviewing or Modifying Contact and/or Customer Information or Terminating Contacts and/or Customers Membership<h4> 
<span>An Adaptivity Contact and/or Customer may choose at any time to review, modify or permanently remove the information stored by Adaptivity about that Contact and/or Customer by sending an email to <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@adaptivity.com">unsubscribe@adaptivity.com</a> to terminate the account. If a Contact and/or Customer terminates their Contacts and/or customer relationship, the past Contact and/or Customer will no longer receive any communications from Adaptivity. Adaptivity will not sell, rent, or otherwise use the information about former Contacts and/or Customers.</span>
<BR></BR> 
<h4>Policy Changes<h4> 
<span>The foregoing policy is effective as of January 2008. Adaptivity reserves the right to change this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of Adaptivity's services following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes. Adaptivity will take reasonable measures to notify you if there is a material change in our privacy practices with respect to use of the information you have provided to Adaptivity. Adaptivity will conspicuously post these changes in our Privacy Policy. Adaptivity also will post a message on the home page of its Web site that states that the Privacy Policy has been changed, and will provide a link to the Privacy Policy. These postings will occur on Adaptivity's Web site at least 30 days prior to any material change. If you have any questions about this privacy statement, Adaptivity practices, or feel that your privacy has been compromised, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@adaptivity.com">privacy@adaptivity.com</a>.</span>
